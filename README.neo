STDIN Reverser


Take input from STDIN and reverse it on STDOUT

-- notes

- A very basic rust program

- I needed a long running app that reads
from STDIN and responds on STDOUT. I 
built this for that purpose

- Running the program starts it waiting for
input on STDIN

- When STDIN is received, it gets reversed
and send back to STDOUT

- The process keeps waiting for STDIN
until an empty string is sent to STDIN 
(this can be an empty newline on the
terminal)
